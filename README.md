# Enhancing Network Security Against DDoS Attacks ðŸš¨

## Overview
In today's digital landscape, securing network devices is more critical than ever. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks pose significant threats, leading to severe disruptions and damage. Establishing an effective detection system is essential for monitoring and mitigating these anomalies.

With the rise of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)â€”which separates the control plane from the data planeâ€”we gain enhanced flexibility and faster communication. However, this innovation also introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to DDoS attacks.

To address these challenges, we have implemented Machine Learning and Ensemble Models for DDoS attack detection. Our comparative analysis highlights the strengths of these approaches in improving network resilience.

## Key Areas Covered
- **DDoS Attack Dynamics**: Understanding the mechanisms and impacts of DDoS attacks on network infrastructure.
- **Advantages and Vulnerabilities of SDN**: Exploring how SDN architecture enhances network management while exposing new risks.
- **Machine Learning vs. Ensemble Models for DDoS Detection**: A comparative analysis of different models for effective DDoS detection and prevention.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for model building.
- **SDN Frameworks**: Tools and frameworks utilized to simulate SDN environments.
